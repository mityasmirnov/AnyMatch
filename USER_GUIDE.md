| **Down** 🔖 | Save for Later | Save to your Saved Movies list to decide later |

### Using Buttons

If you prefer clicking over swiping, use the buttons below the card:

## AI Recommendations

AnyMatch uses AI to provide personalized movie recommendations based on your swipe history and preferences.

### How It Works

The AI recommendation system analyzes:

1. **Your Swipe Patterns**: Movies you've liked, disliked, and super-liked
2. **Genre Preferences**: Your favorite genres from your profile
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: What similar users are watching
4. **Content Attributes**: Directors, actors, themes, and plot elements

### Getting Recommendations

AI recommendations are automatically integrated into your swipe feed. The system continuously learns from your behavior and adjusts suggestions in real-time.

### Improving Recommendations

To get better recommendations:

- **Swipe Consistently**: The more you swipe, the better the AI understands your taste
- **Update Your Profile**: Keep your genre preferences current
- **Use Super Likes**: Super likes signal strong preferences to the AI
- **Explore Different Genres**: Occasionally swipe on movies outside your comfort zone to help the AI understand your range

## Tips & Tricks

### Maximize Your Matching Success

1. **Communicate with Your Group**: Use external chat apps to discuss movies before swiping
2. **Set Group Guidelines**: Agree on content types, genres, and rating thresholds as a group

2. **Explore International Cinema**: Use genre filters to discover foreign films
3. **Check Streaming Availability**: Filter by platforms you have access to
